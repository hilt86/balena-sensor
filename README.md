If you have been putting off starting your Cybersecurity program here is a turn-key solution to 
kickstart your security program. This network sensor generates information about the status and security of 
your network for the purpose of security monitoring and analysis.


## 3 reasons why you don't need to procrastinate about security

1. The sensor costs $50
2. Elastic Cloud is used as SIEM $32 per month (you can afford it!)
3. It takes less than an hour to setup

## 6 reasons why this is not a Toy security solution

1. RPI3 can monitor 50Mbps uplink (tested)
2. RPI3 can probably monitor 100Mbps uplink (educated guess)
3. If you use an Intel NUC as sensor can monitor up to 1Gpbs uplink (educated guess)
4. Elastic Cloud can scale past the point where money is an object
5. You can do serious security analysis and threat hunting
6. Commercial support is available
